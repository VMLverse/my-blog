Hello, I'm Vimal Venugopal and I'm Senior Principal Professional Services Consultant at Genesys. I know that's a lot of words, but in simple terms, our company sells their Enterprise Cloud Software for Call Ceneters and am responsible for leading the implementation and addressing all the customer requirements from inception to production go live. Although my profession as a consultant is exciting, my interest lie in Machine Learning and Programming in General. And that leads to the reason why I undertook the [OMSCS Program](https://omscs.gatech.edu/home) at Georgia Tech.

As a current graduate of Machine Learning Masters program at Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia (Online Masters), I am equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in a career as a Machine Learning Engineer. Throughout my studies, I have gained expertise in machine learning algorithms, data modeling, and predictive analysis.

In my program, I worked on several challenging projects, such as implementing a Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm (Fix Match) with a CNN model, configuring a multi-agent Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithm and training it in a reduced Google football multi-agent environment. These projects allowed me to develop a deep understanding of machine learning and its practical applications.

I also have experience working with various programming languages, including Python & Java. I am familiar with data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection techniques, and have experience with  machine learning frameworks, such as PyTorch.

In addition my current role as a Professional Service Consultant has given me Strong Analytical & Problem-solving skills to identify problems, develop and implement solutions, and evaluate their effectiveness. My experience has also given me the ability to communicate effectively & work collaboratively in a team environment. Being a PS consultant, I also excel at learning new technologies and adapting to changing circumstances as needed.

In my free time, I indulge myself in [Photography](https://www.instagram.com/vimstargram/), Reading books & [Writing Blogs](https://cognitivescrawls.wordpress.com/).
